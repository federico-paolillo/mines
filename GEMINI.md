# Project: mines

## General information

It is a client-server Minesweeper clone. The server is written in Go 1.25 and exposes an HTTP API that will be invoked by a frontend (the client, yet to be implemented). It features an Open API specification that will be the contract consumed by the frontend. A peculiarity of this implementation is that each game of Minesweeper has a TTL of 2 hours maximum. Each game can be created and adressed with a reasonably unique identifier. Concurrency controls features have been implemented using an optimistic offline lock and common Go cncurrency primitives. The goal is to ensure that the frontend can issue multiple moves from different instances of the same frontend. The project is in the process of moving from a custom in-memory and in-process game store to memcached as the backing in-memory store for all games (durability of the game data is a non-goal). The migration to memcached is essential to make the server scalable across multiple replicas, taking advantage of memcached TTL mechanism and to use memcached concurrency features using memcached CAS id. The game server can be configured using environment variables or a YAML file (see config.example.yml). Coding style is enforce through golangci-lint and related configuration (see .golangci.yml). Lefthook is used as the task runner (see lefthook.yml). The file package.json exists solely to keep track of the Gemini CLI version and has no other purpose than to scope a Gemini CLI version to this project. Tests are written using the built-in Go testing framework and use `testify` to simplify writing assertions.

## Project structure

The project structure takes loose inspiration from [https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout](Golang Standards: Project Layout). Main executables are within the `/cmd` folder. `/cmd/server` is the main executable for the HTTP Server with the game logic while `/cmd/gc` is the in-process garbage collector that should delete expired Minesweeper games from the game store. The garbage collector will be eliminated once the migration to memcached is complete. `/bin` contains executables using during development (all are code generators). `/docs` contains the Open API specification automatically generated by swag when invoked via CLI. `internal/` has most application logic and server related functionality. `pkg/` contains the domain of the project with all essential data structures and the actual Minesweeper game logic.

## Interesting Components

### pkg/mines/mines.go

This is the composition root in the dependency injection sense: a Composition Root is a (preferably) unique location in an application where modules are composed together. It is a bag of objects that carries all services and other injectables that can be used by the application code. Because we cannot really perform everywhere constructor injection, we pass this composition root around very much like Go's `context.Context`. This pattern is commonly found in many Go applications.

### pkg/mines/config/config.go

This is the definition of the application configuration along with default values. The file `load.go` uses the library `configuro` to read environment variables, files and defaults to produce a complete configuration object.

### internal/storage

This folder contains all that is needed to save games state. The productive implementation will use memcached (see `internal/storage/memcached`, still TODO). Anything related to the reaper will be removed from the application because we will use the in-memory storage only for testing. Integration tests with `Testcontainers` and memcached will have to be written.

### internal/gc

This is the main garbage collector implementation for game data. This component will be removed once the move to memcached is complete.
